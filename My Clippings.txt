Los protones son partículas minúsculas que componen el núcleo de los átomos, y la energía que se origina de sus colisiones es insignificante si la trasladamos a nuestra vida cotidiana, pero allí donde tales colisiones ocurren concentradas en el espacio infinitesimal, recrean condiciones extremas que no se han vuelto a dar desde el Big Bang.

Además, utilizan tecnologías diferentes para garantizar la completa independencia de las mediciones: si uno de los dos descubre una nueva partícula, el otro tiene que poder confirmar el resultado.

Somos lo que la gente llama «científicos», tropas especiales del conocimiento que la humanidad sitúa en la vanguardia para entender cómo funciona la naturaleza. Mentes flexibles, curiosas, sin prejuicios y dispuestas a acoger cualquier sorpresa, conscientes de que para poder ajustar el mundo a nuestras categorías mentales es necesario librarse de cualquier residuo de sentido común y adentrarse en territorio desconocido. En los límites del conocimiento estás solo, en un mundo donde solo resuenan la intuición de los poetas y la voz de los locos; son los únicos seres humanos que, como nosotros, no temen aventurarse por lugares ignotos; por esta razón los siento cercanos. De algún modo me hacen compañía, porque son valientes, aman el riesgo, no les da miedo acercar el pensamiento a aquellas fronteras que es necesario explorar para comprender de verdad algo de nosotros y del mundo que nos rodea. Como ellos, somos funámbulos caminando sobre la cuerda sin arnés de seguridad.

Cuando miramos las estrellas, tan distantes, los fotones que impactan sobre nuestras retinas y activan sus células fotosensibles llevan años viajando; algunos, los procedentes de las estrellas más lejanas, durante miles de años. La imagen que reconstruye nuestro cerebro es la del astro en el instante preciso en que ha emitido esa luz, quizá hace miles de años. Nadie puede asegurarnos que entretanto esa estrella no se haya trasladado a millones de kilómetros, o incluso que se haya extinguido, iluminando el cielo con una espectacular supernova.

Explica por qué el universo es tan homogéneo en cualquier dirección y por qué vivimos en un mundo donde no hay monopolios magnéticos, esto es, polos norte y sur aislados de sus respectivas parejas, lo cual haría que las ecuaciones del electromagnetismo fueran perfectamente simétricas. La teoría del Big Bang conjeturaba que esos polos debían existir en algún lugar.

Al principio pensábamos que todo giraba alrededor de nuestro planeta; luego (tras muchos esfuerzos) pusimos el Sol en el centro del mundo. Y cuando nos dimos cuenta de que nuestro Sol es una estrella dentro de una galaxia secundaria y anónima, una de tantas (quizá centenares de miles de millones) que pueblan nuestro universo, nos quedaba el consuelo de que vivíamos en un «universo» único y especial, nacido de ese irrepetible evento que lleva por nombre Big Bang. Ahora la teoría de los multiversos parece querer arrancarnos también esta última convicción, abandonándonos a nuestra suerte en la búsqueda de razones para saber qué papel jugamos nosotros en todo esto.

estas galaxias contienen cantidades ingentes de otro ingrediente difícil de identificar. De no ser así, las estrellas periféricas no podrían moverse a la velocidad observada, sino que deberían ir mucho más lentas. El resultado: una materia invisible, inexplicable y que no emite luz —por ello recibe el nombre de «materia oscura»— envuelve completamente las galaxias llenando todo el espacio que ocupan y rodeando sus enormes dimensiones de un «gas» pesado y ligero cuya composición nos es completamente desconocida.

Hasta hace pocos años se esperaba que a causa de la atracción gravitacional recíproca de todas las formas de materia la velocidad con que se alejaban disminuyera con el tiempo; en cambio, al estudiar las galaxias más lejanas, a finales de los noventa se demostró que su velocidad no solo no disminuía, sino que aumentaba. Algo acelera las galaxias, una especie de antigravedad que hace que crezca la distancia entre una isla de materia y otra.

El Modelo Estándar considera que la materia está constituida por tres familias de quarks y tres de leptones que, al reaccionar entre sí y combinarse mediante leyes concretas, producen todo lo que nos rodea. Las doce partículas elementales (tres parejas de quarks y tres parejas de leptones) interactúan entre sí intercambiándose otras partículas, los portadores de las cuatro fuerzas fundamentales: el fotón, la partícula de que se compone la luz, transmite la conocida fuerza electromagnética, mientras que los gluones, portadores de la fuerza de color, transmiten la interacción fuerte, que mantiene unidos los quarks dentro de los protones, y que prevalece sobre la repulsión electroestática entre protones en el núcleo.

El radio de acción de la fuerza electromagnética es infinito: los fotones que emiten las farolas que iluminan nuestras calles de noche acabarán por llegar a los rincones más remotos del cosmos; por otro lado, durante milenios, hemos vivido ignorando la interacción débil, porque solo se manifiesta en las diminutas distancias subnucleares y no sobrevive fuera de estas. Una ley general de la física nos dice que el radio de acción de una fuerza es inversamente proporcional a la masa de la partícula que la transporta; he aquí por qué la fuerza electromagnética tiene un radio de acción infinito: es un regalo que solo puede hacer el fotón, cuya masa es nula.

Es posible que el frágil equilibrio sobre el que se sustenta nuestro universo esté construido de este modo: así, los fotones nos traen la luz de las estrellas más lejanas mientras las interacciones débiles que mantienen el Sol encendido se ocultan a nuestros ojos, recluidas como están en distancias subnucleares.

Faraday, Hertz, Maxwell y Lorentz demostraron que los fenómenos eléctricos producen efectos magnéticos y viceversa, todo se volvió más simple y natural; con un puñado de elegantes fórmulas se describen los fenómenos más dispares. Cuando, más tarde, se descubrió que los que propagan esta interacción son los fotones y que la luz visible no es más que una onda electromagnética particular, una perturbación del campo que se propaga a través del espacio, también la óptica pasó a formar parte de la familia.

El mecanismo es simple: las tres interacciones fundamentales se caracterizan por tres números, llamados «constantes de acoplamiento», que definen la intensidad; cuanto mayor es la constante, mayor es la intensidad de la fuerza. Los valores de las tres constantes son conocidos por todo el mundo. Si por convención indicamos la constante de acoplamiento de la fuerza fuerte con un 1, la electromagnética vale 1/137, es decir, la fuerza electromagnética es cien veces más débil que la fuerte, y la fuerza débil es más o menos un millonésimo de la fuerte.

Los valores de las constantes de acoplamiento, es decir, la intensidad de las fuerzas, no son estáticos e inamovibles; esas constantes no son firmes, sino que dependen de la energía. Si la energía aumenta, los fuertes se vuelven más débiles y los débiles, más fuertes.

Al realizar estas extrapolaciones se ha descubierto que la presencia de nuevas partículas, como las que plantea la supersimetría, podría hacer converger las tres interacciones en un punto bien definido donde las constantes de acoplamiento tuvieran exactamente el mismo valor; este se considera otro punto a favor de la supersimetría.

Para la constante de acoplamiento gravitacional vale todo lo dicho para las demás interacciones: si la energía aumenta, aumenta la constante, pero en este caso el mecanismo de la unificación no funciona. El valor inicial de la constante es tan bajo que incluso cuando las demás interacciones han alcanzado la unificación, la gravedad se mantiene absolutamente aislada, tremendamente débil.

Esta anomalía de la gravedad será el tormento de generaciones enteras de físicos. La fuerza más común, esa que sentimos a diario, es a su vez la que se comporta de un modo más extraño, pero el deseo de unificar las cuatro fuerzas de la naturaleza, incluida la gravedad, se mantiene. Y tiene un nombre ambicioso: la Teoría del Todo. Es el sueño secreto de cualquier físico.

Algunas versiones de las teorías prevén para este caso la aparición de partículas sumamente compactas, con propiedades parecidas a las del Modelo Estándar pero mucho más pesadas; o incluso nuevos estados de la materia totalmente insólitos para los cuales la fuerza de gravedad sería mucho más fuerte de lo normal. Así pues, sería posible producir un conglomerado de partículas subatómicas que estuvieran unidas no ya por la fuerza electromagnética, como los electrones en un átomo, ni por la fuerza nuclear, como los quarks en el núcleo, sino por la gravedad. En distancias reducidas la atracción gravitacional sería tan fuerte que podría formar agujeros negros microscópicos; nada que ver con los agujeros negros cósmicos, gigantescos cuerpos celestes ubicados en el centro de muchas galaxias, tan compactos que son invisibles porque devoran incluso la luz.

Para descubrir nuevas partículas es necesario un acelerador de partículas capaz de producirlas; es decir, capaz de generar colisiones en las cuales se produzca una energía superior a la masa de partículas que se quiere crear. Es una aplicación de la famosa relación de equivalencia entre masa y energía, enunciada por Einstein. Cuando un haz de partículas colisiona con otro, la energía de la colisión puede transformarse en masa: cuanto mayor es la energía del choque, más compactas son las partículas que pueden producirse y más nos acercamos a comprender los primeros instantes de vida del universo que siguieron al Big Bang; de ahí que cada día se quieran construir máquinas más potentes.

La desventaja de las máquinas basadas en electrones y positrones es que no permiten alcanzar energías demasiado elevadas. De hecho, estas partículas son ligeras, y cuando se mueven en órbitas circulares pierden una parte significativa de su energía por irradiación, emitiendo una especie de luz que recibe el nombre de luz de sincrotrón.

Por otro lado, el número de partículas que produce el acelerador varía en función del número de colisiones al segundo que es capaz de producir para ese proceso en particular; es lo que en léxico técnico se llama «luminosidad» del acelerador. La elección de estos dos parámetros fundamentales, energía y luminosidad de la máquina, es la más importante, ya que puede determinar el éxito o fracaso de una gran empresa científica.

La superconductividad es una propiedad muy especial de algunos materiales no resistentes a la corriente. De este modo se evitan los inconvenientes de los conductores normales y se pueden producir corrientes muy elevadas con una dispersión mínima. Las corrientes elevadas son el principal ingrediente en la construcción de fuertes campos magnéticos, necesarios para mantener en órbita los protones de alta energía, pero la superconductividad no es fácil de gestionar. Ante todo porque en estos materiales la resistencia se anula únicamente a temperaturas próximas al cero absoluto: los filamentos superconductores tienen que estar inmersos en la sustancia más fría de que disponemos, es decir, el helio líquido, a temperaturas que rondan los −269 °C. En segundo lugar porque estos materiales tienden a perder la superconductividad en presencia de campos magnéticos intensos y corrientes elevadas,

Los 14 TeV del LHC implican que la producción de partículas compactas como el bosón de Higgs será menor, lo que equivale a menos posibilidades de ganar la carrera contra los americanos, pero lo que se pierde en energía se puede ganar en luminosidad. Rubbia decide que el LHC tendrá una luminosidad diez veces superior a la del SSC, pero una elevada luminosidad significa haces de altísima intensidad, un número de partículas casi imposible de gestionar y la posibilidad de que los detectores acaben «fritos» por la radiación.

El sueño de aquel reducido grupo de pioneros hoy se ha hecho realidad y, como suele ocurrir, ahora parece una historia repleta de éxitos y gloria. En realidad, ha sido una aventura arriesgada y dificilísima, siempre a medio camino entre el éxito apabullante y el riesgo de fracasar.

Un detector moderno de partículas es una especie de cámara fotográfica digital enorme. Su funcionamiento es simple: en cada acelerador hay una o más zonas especiales, llamadas «zonas de interacción», donde los haces se entrecruzan, se concentran en dimensiones infinitésimas y dan lugar a las colisiones; para registrar y comprender qué ocurre durante los choques se usan sistemas de detectores, complejos aparatos basados en sensores muy sensibles y capaces de registrar hasta la más mínima liberación de energía por parte de las partículas que salen de la zona de interacción.

En el acelerador los protones viajan agrupados en paquetes sumamente densos. Cada paquete contiene alrededor de 100 millardos de protones que en cuanto alcanzan la zona de interacción se concentran en una región filiforme de unos 0,01 milímetros de diámetro y 10 centímetros de largo. El intervalo de tiempo que separa dos paquetes contiguos es de 25 nanosegundos (es decir, millardésimos de segundo) y el LHC puede contener hasta un máximo de 2800 paquetes. En otras palabras, las colisiones del LHC son pulsadas, ocurren en intervalos de tiempo muy concretos, regulados por un circuito de sincronización muy preciso. Los sensores que rodean la zona de interacción reciben una señal que anuncia la llegada del paquete de protones y preparan el circuito de lectura para que pueda registrar lo que ocurre alrededor de la zona de interacción durante la colisión.

Cada imagen ocupa un megabyte, más o menos lo mismo que una fotografía digital; lo asombroso es la velocidad a la que ocurre. Los detectores del LHC toman fotografías digitales al apabullante ritmo de 40 millones de imágenes por segundo.

Para resolver este problema se han incorporado a los detectores miles de microprocesadores conectados entre sí; de este modo, mientras se registran localmente las señales emitidas por la colisión, los microprocesadores reconstruyen la información global y elaboran rápidamente una hipótesis acerca del tipo de colisión que se ha producido. Como hemos podido observar anteriormente, la gran mayoría de veces las colisiones entre protones producen partículas ligeras y fenómenos físicos bien conocidos, que son inmediatamente descartados. La atención se concentra en eventos potencialmente interesantes, que son mucho más raros. El circuito que efectúa esta selección se llama «circuito que aprieta el gatillo» o «circuito de trigger», y en millonésimas de segundo decide qué eventos registra y cuáles descarta; de los 40 millones de eventos al segundo se guardarán apenas mil.

dado que la mayor apuesta del LHC es su alta luminosidad, el número de partículas que se producirá a cada segundo en la zona de interacción será muy elevado. Así pues, todo lo que haya alrededor de esta zona —sensores, electrónica, estructuras de soporte, cables y fibra para las señales— tendrá que ser resistente a unos niveles de radiación nunca vistos.

Ha pasado más de un siglo desde que lord Rutherford demostró que era posible estudiar la estructura más íntima de la materia bombardeando una finísima hoja de oro con núcleos de helio —que por aquel entonces se llamaban «partículas alfa»— emitidos por la desintegración de una sustancia radiactiva. Al visualizar las partículas, desviadas en grandes ángulos, Rutherford demostró ingeniosamente y de forma inequívoca que el átomo de oro poseía un núcleo muy pequeño donde se concentraba toda la carga positiva. Ese experimento permitió construir un modelo atómico que sigue en boga (una nube de electrones moviéndose alrededor del núcleo), abrió el camino hacia la mecánica cuántica (ya que la mecánica clásica era incapaz de explicar cómo era posible que en su movimiento los electrones no perdieran energía por irradiación y acabaran cayendo en el núcleo) y se convirtió en el pilar de los experimentos modernos con los grandes aceleradores de partículas.

Solo los electrones y los protones de alta energía de los aceleradores de partículas permiten visualizar los detalles del protón, cuyo tamaño es de un femtómetro (10−15 metros), o incluso de sus componentes, como los quarks, cuyo tamaño es inferior a un attómetro (10−18 metros); y si los quarks también fueran objetos compuestos, igual que los protones, su estructura podría ser sondeada en un futuro con proyectiles suficientemente energéticos como para permitir explorar las infinitesimales dimensiones de estos nuevos componentes elementales de la materia.

Las dudas están más que justificadas. Para construir el nuevo acelerador hace falta un salto de calidad respecto a lo que se ha hecho hasta el momento. Para mantener en órbita protones con 7 TeV de energía, los imanes tendrán que probarse con hasta 9,7 teslas, un campo magnético casi cien veces mayor que el terrestre, un valor que hasta el momento no ha alcanzado ningún acelerador.

El diseño de los dos haces circulando por el mismo imán utilizado por Giorgio Brianti es elegante e ingenioso, pero también complejo; cualquier imperfección, por insignificante que sea, repercutiría catastróficamente en la estabilidad de las órbitas. Mantener bajo control durante diez o doce horas haces de alta intensidad que realizan 11 000 giros por segundo en un anillo de 27 kilómetros es una empresa extraordinariamente difícil.

Pero esta no es nuestra única preocupación. Los protones pierden poca energía a causa de la irradiación de luz de sincrotrón, y los efectos sobre el haz circulante no son importantes, pero la energía que se pierde se deposita en componentes de la máquina que operan a temperaturas muy bajas y es necesario que el sistema de criogenia sea dimensionado de modo que pueda absorber esta fuente de inestabilidad.

Por último tenemos el daño por radiación. Todo lo que haya en el túnel recibirá el impacto de flujos de partículas que pondrán a prueba cualquier sistema. Los circuitos de alimentación y los sistemas de control tendrán que sobrevivir a situaciones en las cuales la electrónica ordinaria deja de funcionar al cabo de pocos meses. Todo tendrá que diseñarse utilizando innovadores componentes que todavía no existen; también tendrán que inventarse nuevos materiales para sustituir a los que se deforman, se endurecen o se quiebran por efecto de la radiación en las zonas más expuestas.

Al final, entre los retrasos técnicos y la necesidad de absorber los costes extras, todo se pospuso lenta pero inexorablemente unos diez años. Y los 2660 millones de francos que se habían propuesto en 1994 se convirtieron en otra cifra mucho más realista: 4600 millones.

I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” he said.

I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin. And I want you always to remember that donkey. Never forget that fear and desire can lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re not aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want you to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”

My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset column. The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows. The more my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my expenses less than the cash flow from these assets, I grow richer with more and more income from sources other than my physical labor.

Robert teaches that a home is a liability, because it takes money out of your pocket—not only with taxes and expenses, but because of its loss in value and the opportunities missed when all your money is tied up in your house. And that causes you to lose out on the education of investment experience.

When there are enough assets to generate more than enough income to cover expenses, the balance is reinvested into assets. Which grows the asset column on a balance sheet. Which produces more income. The result is that the rich who understand the difference between assets and liabilities, get richer.

It is this Robin Hood fantasy, or taking from the rich to give to the poor, that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal. The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who pays for the poor.

How did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “take-from-the-rich” tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers. Initially, people were happy. Money was handed out to government workers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of jobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving government contracts. The government received a large pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal management of that money. The government ideal is to avoid having excess money. If you fail to spend your allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the other hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are applauded for their efficiency. As this cycle of growing government spending continued, the demand for money increased, and the “tax-the-rich” idea was adjusted to include lower-income levels, down to the very people who voted it in, the poor and the middle class.

If an opportunity lands in your lap and you have no money and the bank won’t talk to you, what else can you do to get the opportunity to work in your favor? If your hunch is wrong, and what you’ve been counting on doesn’t happen, how can you turn a lemon into millions? That is financial intelligence.

Alexander Graham Bell gave the market what it wanted. So did Bill Gates. A $75,000 house offered for $60,000 that cost $20,000 was also the result of seizing an opportunity created by the market. Somebody was buying, and someone was selling. 4.​The law The law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and federal regulations. I recommend playing by the rules.

The point I would like to make is that investments come and go. The market goes up and comes down. Economies improve and crash. The world is always handing you opportunities of a lifetime, every day of your life, but all too often we fail to see them. But they are there. And the more the world changes and the more technology changes, the more opportunities there will be to allow you and your family to be financially secure for generations to come.

the greater your financial intelligence, the easier it is to tell whether a deal is good. It’s your intelligence that can spot a bad deal, or make a bad deal good. The more we learn—and there is a lot to learn—the more money we make simply because we gain experience and wisdom as the years go on. We have friends who are playing it safe, working hard at their profession, and failing to gain financial wisdom, which does take time to develop.

When it comes to financial success and wealth, there tend to be two leading narratives or mindsets as to how it comes about. Either we believe that:    Rich people got rich through hard work. Rich people deserve their riches. They earned their financial success (meritocracy). Or that:    Rich people got rich through random events outside their control. It’s all about luck, timing, natural talent, and fate. Their financial success is unearned (fatalism). You can think of these mindsets as opposite ends of a spectrum. The reality, of course, is firmly in the middle.

If we don’t really understand it, we might be tempted to complain and moan about not having certain unfair advantages or we may wonder why some other people have been endowed with so many. We might throw our hands up and say that, if it’s all down to the luck of the draw, then we may as well not bother.

We might throw our hands up and say that, if it’s all down to the luck of the draw, then we may as well not bother. You have read how both hard work and luck played vital roles in both of our entrepreneurial journeys. We both worked extremely hard, but at the same time we also got very lucky.

There has recently been a big surge in self-help books and videos that say that talent doesn’t exist, that it’s somehow all about hard work, practice, and putting in the “10,000 hours.” Bullsh*t. We give these examples to show that natural, innate talent absolutely does exist. With the ultrasuccessful, it is usually the foundation from which they build their skills and turn them into a superpower through the 10,000 hours of practice.

Did Warren work hard? Did he get his 10,000 hours? Absolutely, he did. And hard work also plays a very important role, because it’s true that hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard. But combine the two and that’s when you get rocket fuel.

That’s how these statistical anomalies of megasuccess are made: with a very large endowment of luck, and hard work—and usually the hard work is something that comes easily to them because of their natural talent for it, as well as their passion and obsession with it, which means that they’re happy to put in the hours.

So we’re not all fortunate enough to love what we do, or to even know what our “passion” or “talent” is. The key, as we’ll discuss later in the book, is to experiment and focus on what will add value to others. That way, you can find something valuable to do (i.e., something you will be paid for, whether through entrepreneurship or through employment) and find fulfillment in that.

It may feel defeatist or disempowering to think too much about the idea of luck, because it clashes so drastically with the modern belief that our lives are under our own control. It might also make us feel uneasy because of the idea of fairness. How is it fair for Evan Spiegel to be born with such strong unfair advantages because of his high socioeconomic status? Or you might even say, how is it fair that Oprah was born with such a dynamic and valuable gift? Life isn’t fair.

in the United States for example, if you meet someone at the bottom of society, they might unkindly be described as a “loser.” This pernicious belief is the root cause of a lot of angst and status anxiety in the developed world. We are living in the midst of an epidemic of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Part of that is the extreme aspirational attitude that we have when looking at the rich and famous in newspapers, magazines, and on social media sites such as Instagram.

Investors and venture capitalists (VCs) expect you to be able to articulate what they call “your personal edge,” or your unfair advantage. If you aren’t able to do so, you may have a tough time getting the investments you want. The impact of the founders on an early-stage startup cannot be overstated. That’s why you, the founders, are the ones whom investors will be interviewing. You decide the direction of your company. You set the culture at the company. That is why we focus so closely on founders, and on what you bring to the table from the beginning.

As a company grows and employs more people, and systemizes itself as an entity, the impact of the founders diminishes. The business increases its head count and develops its own systems, policies, and standard operating procedures. From there, rather than having unfair advantages, a company now has sustainable competitive advantages (in the traditional business school sense). Competitive advantages are to businesses what Unfair Advantages are to individuals and early-stage startups.

It is very important to have a sense of “why” as an entrepreneur or founder. At the core of your actions (whether you are aware of it or not) is a deeper belief and sense of purpose guiding the choices you make. Your “why” can change over time based on the experiences you have, but as human beings, when it comes down to it, we’re usually driven by just a few core motivations. As you embark on your startup journey, or any project that you undertake, ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing, and why you have set yourself such a goal.

Due to the arbitrary and unequal distribution of unfair advantages, your “why” is particularly important in terms of how you define success for yourself. Ideally, your “why” must come from you alone, because if it is driven by other people’s expectations, or a need for approval from others, suffering will be the outcome even if you succeed. Asking yourself that question will help you determine your real motivations for striving to achieve what you want to achieve.

You can change your mindset in an instant, simply by looking at your circumstances and your life situation through a different lens. For example, one amazing “mindset hack” is gratitude. Focusing on what you’re grateful for in life can make you feel happier, less stressed and more focused, all without having to change your external circumstances at all. This then allows you to work better and feel better about the work you’ve done. All of which shows how your mindset can affect both the quality and outcomes of your life.

people with a fixed mindset believe they are born naturally gifted at doing some things, but incapable of others. This black-and-white way of thinking often obstructs their development. Failure is a disaster to a person with a fixed mindset. When it happens, they will bury their heads in the sand or blame others.

The opposite of this fixed mindset is a growth mindset. This is when a person believes that all of life is fluid. Yes, you can be bad at something, but it is only because you have not taken the time or attention to get better at it. The growth mindset is perfectly encapsulated in one word: “yet.” “I can’t write code … yet.” “I can’t write a business plan … yet.” “I can’t find a co-founder … yet.” This three-letter word opens up a whole realm of possibilities.

While the growth mindset is by far the better option of the two presented, it still isn’t quite the mindset you need to embrace for success. After all, you can’t really say, “I am not a trillionaire … yet!,” “I’m not a professional footballer … yet!,” “I’m not the first person to travel to Mars … yet!” Realistically, you simply won’t be any of those things. The flaw of the growth mindset idea is that it often ignores the stacks of unfair advantages (and luck) some people already have in life. The first trillionaire is likely to be a tech company titan who is already a billionaire—we’d predict Elon Musk. The people who will succeed as professional footballers are probably less than eighteen years old and have been training to be professional footballers since they were young children. And the first person to travel to Mars is training to be an astronaut right now, or is likely a billionaire again.

The ability to think “The sky is the limit!” is an excellent tool in your mental toolbox. However, there does need to be an element of realism in your thinking, though not one that overly limits you. You need to find the right balance. If you only think “The sky is the limit!,” then your head will be full of crazy daydreams, but when you look around at your life and see the huge disparity between your dreams and your current situation, you may experience guilt, disappointment, and distress. You’ll blame yourself, or you might become bitter and blame everybody else.

A reality-growth mindset is the ability to accept the hard limits of the way things are (like the physical laws of the universe) and also to believe that anything is possible (the metaphysical way of looking at the universe). It acknowledges that there are limitations, but that those limitations are more malleable than people may think.

Reality-growth mindset is the balance between self-awareness and self-belief. Self-awareness says, “I understand I will probably never win a Nobel Prize, or cure cancer, or become president or prime minister, or become the world’s richest person.” Self-belief says, “I am going to succeed in my own way, and even if my goal feels like a stretch, I can step up to the challenge, and probably have a lot more impact than I can even imagine.” Reality-growth mindset is about having your feet rooted on the ground, with your head in the clouds. Not just your head in the clouds believing anything is possible! And not just your feet on the ground thinking, “I can never be above average and ordinary.” You need both! It is about setting achievable goals rather than looking at outliers and anomalies. You want to be on the cover of Forbes or Time magazine? Okay, but how about starting with the goal of creating a company that makes profit, or an organization that has real impact? One thing at a time, then maybe one day that magazine cover will seem like a reasonable goal.

Unfair advantages exist. Talent exists. Luck exists. Sexism, ageism, nepotism, prejudice, social connections, inherited money, better educations—these are all irrefutable truths. By and large, you are born into an extravaganza of fixed variables that you do not control. You must accept this. At the same time, you also must believe you are the master of your own future. You can take responsibility for the outcomes in your life. You can achieve virtually anything you set your mind to, as long as what you set your mind to is within the realms of possibility for you, based on your strengths and assets (your unfair advantages).

the strange world of startups, the time you have until your startup runs out of money and is forced to close down is called your runway time. You could have four months of runway time, or you could have one year. It depends on how much money you have and how much money you’re “burning.” Your “burn rate” is how much money your startup is losing every month. If your startup has £5,000 in the bank, and your burn rate is £1,000 a month, then you have five months of runway time.

I struggled with the endless thinking. It felt as if my mind was permanently switched on, going round and round like a washing machine. Some of the thoughts I liked. A lot of the thoughts I didn’t like. The same was true of the emotions. As if a ‘busy head’ wasn’t enough, I felt as though I was always drifting into unnecessary worry, frustration and sadness. They were quite ordinary levels of emotion, but they had a tendency to spin off out of control every now and then. And when they did, there was nothing I could do about it. It felt as though I was at the mercy of these feelings and would get blown around by them.

Often in life we get so caught up in the analysis, the dissection of every possible outcome, that we miss an opportunity altogether. Of course, some things require careful consideration, but the more we live mindfully, in the moment, the more we start to get a sense of what feels right. Whether you think of it as a gut feeling, intuition, being guided, or just knowing for yourself that it’s the right thing to do, this can be an incredibly liberating discovery.

The more I spoke to people about the benefits of meditation, the more I found that many desperately wanted to find a way to relax, but were uncomfortable with the religious element that robes automatically imply. They simply wanted to find a way to cope with life, to deal with stress – in their work, their personal life, and in their own minds. They wanted to regain the sense of openness they remembered from childhood, that sense of appreciation in actually being alive. They weren’t looking for spiritual enlightenment, nor were they needing therapy. They just wanted to know how to ‘switch off’ when they got home from work, how to fall asleep at night, how to improve their relationships, how to feel less anxious, sad or angry. People wanted to know how to control their cravings, to give up their addictions, to get a bit more perspective on life. But most of all they wanted to know how to deal with that nagging feeling that all was not quite as it should be, or could be – that feeling that there must be more to life than this.

it’s useful to know how other people use meditation, to appreciate its full potential. For many it’s the all-round stress buster, an aspirin for the mind. In short, a way of getting some headspace each day. For some, it’s the foundation of a broader approach to mindfulness, an opportunity to touch base with what it means to be present and in the moment throughout the day. For others, it might be part of a personal development plan towards greater emotional stability, or integrated into a spiritual path of some kind. And then there are those who turn to meditation as a way of improving their relationships with partners, parents, children, friends, colleagues and associates.

Meditation is also used in much more specific ways. Ever since the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) approved the use of meditation (or mindfulness as it’s known in the medical world), it’s been used to treat a wide range of stress-related health symptoms. These include, but are no means limited to, chronic anxiety, depression, anger, addiction, compulsive behaviour, insomnia, muscle tension, sexual dysfunction and PMS.

Away from the medical world, but still with the intention of targeting one specific aspect of life, many people use meditation to give them an extra edge in a particular discipline, job, hobby or sport (the US Olympic team being a good example). And finally, stretching the boundaries of your imagination, meditation has even been adopted by the US marines to make them more focused and efficient on the front line.

As well as being a skill, meditation is also an experience. This means you need to do it in order to fully appreciate its value. Meditation is not just another fluffy concept, or philosophical idea; rather, it’s a direct experience of the present moment. In the same way that it’s up to you to define the purpose of meditation, it’s also up to you to define the experience of meditation.

Meditation is a wonderful skill with life-changing potential, but how you choose to use that skill is up to you. With increasing coverage of meditation and mindfulness in the media, many people seem to be in a hurry to define its purpose. But the truth is, you define the purpose by deciding how you choose to use it.

Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person. It’s about training in awareness and understanding how and why you think and feel the way you do, and getting a healthy sense of perspective in the process. It just so happens that when you do that, any changes you want to make in your life become that much more feasible. More than that, it shows you how to be OK with the way you are right now and how you feel. But put it to the test. Don’t simply believe it works because that’s what the scientists say.

neuroscientists are now able to observe the brain in a whole new way. This means that they’ve been able to discover exactly what happens to the brain when we’re learning to meditate, and also some of the effects of long-term practice. At first it was assumed that it was simply the activity of the brain that changed during meditation, but multiple studies have shown that the structure of the brain itself can change, in a process known as neuroplasticity. So, in the same way that training the body can make a particular muscle thicker and stronger, so training the mind with meditation can make the area of the brain associated with happiness and wellbeing thicker and stronger.

mindfulness means to be present. It means being ‘in the moment’, experiencing life directly as it unfolds, rather than being distracted, caught up and lost in thought. It’s not a contrived or temporary state of mind that you need to somehow create and maintain. On the contrary, it’s a way of stepping back and resting the mind in its natural state, free from the usual chaos.

‘headspace’. It describes an underlying sense of peace, a feeling of fulfilment or unshakeable contentment, no matter what emotion might be in play at that time. Headspace is not a quality of mind dependent on surface emotions; this means it can be experienced just as clearly in periods of sadness or anger as it can in times of excitement and laughter. Essentially it’s ‘being OK’ with whatever thoughts you’re experiencing or emotions you’re feeling.

For some reason we’ve come to believe that happiness should be the default setting in life and, therefore, anything different is somehow wrong. Based on this assumption we tend to resist the source of unhappiness – physically, mentally and emotionally. It’s usually at this stage that things get complicated. Life can begin to feel like a chore, and an endless struggle to chase and maintain that feeling of happiness.

He replied that it hadn’t changed the way he felt, but had instead changed his experience of those feelings. He said that while he still felt a great sense of loss and sadness at times, he perceived it differently. He described how he’d found a place beneath those thoughts and feelings where there was a sense of peace, of stillness and of calm. He said that it was the one thing that could never be taken away from him, that no matter what else happened to him in life, he would always have this place within himself to return to.

When they’re at work they’re too busy, too distracted, to be aware of how they really feel, so when they get home they’re suddenly confronted by lots of thoughts. If they manage to keep themselves occupied during the evening, then they may not even become aware of these thoughts until they go to bed at night. You know how it goes, you put your head on the pillow and it appears as though the mind suddenly goes into overdrive. Of course, the thoughts have been there all along, it’s just that without any distractions you become aware of them. Or it can be the other way around. Some people have such busy social lives or family lives that it’s not until they get to work that they become aware of just how frazzled they feel, of all the thoughts racing around in the mind.

distractions affect our ability to concentrate, perform and live at anywhere near our optimum level. Needless to say, if the mind is always racing from one thought to the next, then our ability to focus will be seriously impaired.

Exercise 2: the senses Take another two minutes to do this short exercise. As before, stay sitting exactly as you are right now. After putting the book down in your lap, gently focus on one of the physical senses, preferably sound or sight at this stage. I’d recommend using background sounds and closing your eyes, but as sounds can be a little unpredictable at times, you might prefer to keep your eyes open and gaze at a particular object in the room instead, or perhaps a point on the wall. Whichever sense you choose, try focusing on it for as long as possible, but in a very light and easy way. If you get distracted by thoughts or other physical senses, simply bring your attention back to the object of focus and continue as before. How did you find it?

Exercise 1: not doing Try it now. Without moving from where you’re sitting, just close the book and place it in your lap. You don’t need to sit in any particular way, but just gently close your eyes and sit for a minute or two. It’s no problem if lots of thoughts pop up, you can let them come and go for now, but see what it feels like to sit still, not doing anything, for just a minute or two.

Mindfulness doesn’t require you to change anything. In becoming increasingly aware of your own mind you may find you choose to make some changes in your external life, but that’s entirely up to you. There’s no need to give everything up, or radically change your lifestyle in any way. Dramatic changes like this are rarely sustainable, which is what makes a mindful way of living so achievable. You can keep living as you always have done, if that’s what you want to do. Mindfulness is about learning how to change your experience of that lifestyle. It’s about finding a way to live as you are, but with an underlying sense of fulfilment. And then, if you feel as though you want to make some changes, then of course feel free. The difference is, any changes you make will be sustainable.

Many people I know say that even when they’re asleep at night it feels as though the cogs just keep on turning. So it’s no coincidence that the rate of stress-related illness has increased at the same time as our lives have become more complicated. According to the UK National Office of Statistics, the prevalence of anxiety, depression, irritability, addiction and compulsive behaviour have all risen sharply in recent years, accompanied by all the usual physical symptoms of stress such as fatigue, hypertension and insomnia.

meditation was just one part of three key aspects. The first part of the training would be understanding how to approach the technique. This means discovering the dynamics of the mind and how it’s likely to behave when you practise the technique. Only then would you be introduced to the actual meditation techniques. But there was a third aspect too. Having gained a sense of familiarity with the technique, the emphasis would be on the integration of that quality of mind into everyday life.

the first thing to get straight is that meditation does not make you think! All it does is shine a big bright light on your mind so that you can see it more clearly. This bright light is awareness. You may not like what you see when you switch the light on, but it’s a clear and accurate reflection of how your mind behaves on a daily basis.’

If I was just sitting there as an observer to the thoughts, then who was doing the thinking? Surely I can’t be doing both at the same time? ‘Your thoughts are autonomous,’ he explained. ‘Of course, if you want to think about something you can, you have that ability to reflect, to remember, or to project into the future and imagine how things might be. But what about the thoughts that just “pop” into your mind when you sit to meditate, or when you’re walking down the street, or sitting at your desk trying to read a book? What about those thoughts? You didn’t bring those thoughts to mind, did you? They came to mind. One minute you’re reading a book and the next the thought of an old friend “pops” into your mind. You haven’t thought of this friend for a long time and you made no conscious effort to bring him to mind and yet, all of a sudden, there he is!’ This was definitely something I’d experienced a lot. I don’t know if it’s something that ever happens to you, but I’d often start reading a page of a book, only to reach the end and realise that not a word had gone in. Inevitably, somewhere along the way a thought had popped up and I’d become distracted, often without even being aware of it.

‘When it comes to unpleasant feelings we’re always trying to get rid of them, right? This also creates tension. This way we’re doing the opposite of what we normally do, which means there’s no resistance. And no resistance means no tension.’ I thought about it, it made a certain amount of sense. In fact, it sounded like an elaborate version of reverse psychology. I guess the interesting thing was that it trained the mind to be more altruistic at the same time.

When I had the attitude of sharing pleasant sensations they seemed to last longer, and the meditation became more enjoyable. It’s hard to say what changed exactly, but I guess it became a little less self-serving. The other aspect was equally effective. I can’t say that unpleasant emotions or tension immediately disappeared when I applied this method, but the intention had been to find a way to sit with those feelings with a greater sense of confidence and acceptance. And it was true, by imagining that I was doing something beneficial for others, it seemed to make the whole thing easier. This approach to the practice made a considerable difference to my ability and willingness to understand all aspects of the mind. Before that time I’d only wanted to get to know the pleasant sensations and had always feared unpleasant ones. But this changed everything; it was like seeing and understanding a part of my mind that I’d never seen before – and of course I’d never seen it because I was always so busy running away from it.

When it comes to emotions it’s the case that whatever goes down, must come up. It might come to the surface as the emotion itself, or it might start to affect our behaviour in some way. Sometimes it can even affect our physical health. Stress-related health symptoms are increasingly common and widely acknowledged to be a result of our inability to deal with challenging feelings presented by a stressful situation or environment.

when you’re more aware there is very little room for these unpleasant emotions to operate. When you’re thinking about them all the time, then of course you give them lots of room, you keep them active. But if you don’t think about them, then they tend to lose their momentum.’

‘why would you react very strongly when you can’t even find a feeling there to react to? In order to resist something you need to have an idea of what it is. Often our “idea” of a feeling is just that, an idea. When we look a little more closely, we see that the idea is actually not what we thought it was. This makes it very difficult to resist. And with no resistance, there is simply acceptance of the emotion.’

the emotion itself is often not the problem. It’s the way we react to it that causes the problem. For example, I feel angry and respond to it with more anger, stoking the coals, keeping the fire of anger burning. Or I feel worried and I start to feel worried that I feel worried. By stepping back and getting a little bit of perspective (something I could never have done without meditation) I was able to see the original emotion for what it was. And by simply being aware of it, it was as if it had its moment in the sun and was more willing to move on.

sometimes, the ‘idea’ of something can be very different from reality.

the speed at which our emotions change, one feeling morphing into the next, can make them seem impossible to separate and define. Think back to the last time you felt happy, do you remember when it began? Take a minute or so to see if you can pinpoint the very moment the emotion of happiness came into being. And then when did it end? What about the last time you felt angry? You might remember the situation or context for the anger, but can you remember when the feeling of anger began and when it finished? And what caused these emotions to suddenly vanish? Was it that they ran out of steam? Did something else more important grab your attention? Or was it simply replaced by the next feeling?

Emotions affect our perception of people, of situations and the environment in which we live. As a direct consequence, they also affect our relationships with people, situations and the environment in which we live. Emotions are the filter between ‘us’ and the ‘world’. When we feel angry the world can look very threatening: we see situations as obstacles and other people as enemies. And yet when we feel happy, the world can appear as quite a friendly place. We view the same situations as opportunities and the same people as friends. The world around us has not changed that much, but our experience of that world is radically different.

Traits are those emotions that seem to define a character. It might be ‘cheerful Amy’ or ‘moody Mark’. These traits can reflect our upbringing, social conditioning, and the experiences that have shaped us along the way. It’s as if they are part of our genetic code and they tend to feel very ‘set’ in nature.

‘States’ however refer to those fleeting emotions that come and go in everyday life. Perhaps someone says something unpleasant to you, your child takes their first steps, or you get some bad news. These things are likely to be met with the appropriate emotion that will come and then go again, they are the ‘ups and downs’ of life.

Mindfulness is the willingness to rest in that natural state of awareness, resisting the temptation to judge whatever emotion comes up, and therefore neither opposing or getting carried away with a feeling. Meditation is simply the exercise that is going to give you the best conditions to practise being mindful of these emotions. And headspace is the result of applying this approach. Headspace does not mean being free from emotions, but rather existing in a place where you are at ease with whatever emotion is present.

So we come back to the idea of gentle curiosity: watching, observing and noticing what happens in the body and mind as these emotions come and go. Remember, the objective here is headspace, a sense of ease with whatever emotion is present. It means to sit on the roadside, watching the emotions pass, neither getting drawn into them because they look inviting, nor running away from them because they look frightening. The technique is not about trying to stop emotions from arising, in the same way that it’s not about trying to stop thoughts from arising. Like thoughts, emotions spontaneously arise. It’s how we meet these emotions, how we respond to them that is important.

We’re not always very good at recognising how we are feeling. That’s usually because we’re distracted by what we’re doing or what we’re thinking. But when you start to meditate you inevitably start to become more aware of how you feel – the variety of feelings, the intensity of feelings, the stubborn nature of some emotions, and the fleeting nature of others. How do you feel right now, for example?

utilitarian thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill revisited this way of looking at virtue.

But when you start to meditate you inevitably start to become more aware of how you feel – the variety of feelings, the intensity of feelings, the stubborn nature of some emotions, and the fleeting nature of others. How do you feel right now, for example? Put the book down for a couple of minutes and close your eyes. It can be useful to notice how your body feels first, as that can give you a clue as to what the underlying emotion is. Does it feel heavy or does it feel light? Is there a sense of stillness or of restlessness in the body? And is there a sense of restriction or spaciousness? Rather than rush to decide, apply the idea of gentle curiosity and take a good 20 to 30 seconds to answer each question. And how does the breath feel in the body – does it feel fast or slow, deep or shallow? Without trying to change it, take just a few moments to notice how it feels.

When I first heard that meditation was simply a snapshot of my everyday mind I found it hard to believe. I’d never experienced my mind with quite so much awareness and so I’d never seen it that way before. On the one hand, there was a familiarity to it all, but on the other it was not what I was expecting at all. You may have already got a sense of this with your own mind, even from just those few short exercises I’ve outlined. When we meet something new or unexpected, we tend to react to it in a different way to those things that are familiar. Some react with excitement and wonder, others approach it with a sense of anxiety or trepidation. The same is true when it comes to watching the mind.

The qualities you bring to your own approach will always reflect your upbringing and your character. Some of these qualities you might like and find helpful, others may feel uncomfortable and decidedly unhelpful. But if you can bring a sense of genuine intrigue and curiosity to your meditation, then it doesn’t really matter what those qualities are. That’s because they become part of the meditation, part of that which is observed.

The idea of approaching meditation with a gentle curiosity seemed to me to imply a sense of soft, open and patient interest. It’s perhaps the way in which you might quietly crouch behind a tree while watching a wild animal. Because you’re so captivated and engaged, you’re 100 per cent focused on what you’re watching. You are aware of the immediacy of the moment, free from impatience, not wanting the animal to do something, but content to watch it just as it is. Or perhaps it’s like watching an insect on the floor. At first you may look at it and think ‘Oh, it’s a bug.’ But then you look a little closer and see all the legs. So you look a little closer again and see the features on the face. Each time you notice something new about this ‘bug’. If you can apply this sense of gentle curiosity, to your meditation and even everyday life, it will add something that is every bit as beneficial as it is unexpected.

By taking the time to pause, and be curious, I could have so easily avoided the entire situation. Instead, I was so caught up in the pursuit of free time that I ploughed on through.

If fixing a broken tricycle for a kid who loves tricycles is morally better than fixing one for a child who is indifferent to them, then it seems that outcomes must be part of the calculation as well as intentions. This would take it closer to a utilitarian viewpoint, in which we can (theoretically) calculate the exact positive and negative effects of an act we are considering, and choose accordingly.

we need to give the mind something to focus on, something to concentrate on. Traditionally these were known as ‘objects of meditation’ or ‘meditation supports’ and they were classified as external or internal. External supports might include techniques such as gazing at a particular object, listening to a particular sound, or perhaps chanting a particular word or phrase over and over again. This last one, known as a mantra, can also become an internal object, by simply repeating it in the mind rather than out loud. (Fear not, though, we won’t be doing any chanting – that’s really not the Headspace way.) Other internal objects of meditation might include focusing on the breath, bodily sensations, or even visualising a particular image in the mind.

In order to get the very most from meditation, you’ll probably want to integrate it with your everyday life. And in order to do that, you’ll need to add the second component – clarity. This way you get to see what’s causing the tension in the first place, you get to understand how and why you feel the way you do in certain situations. It’s the difference between ‘responding skilfully’ to situations and ‘reacting impulsively’.

Imagine a very still, clear pool of water. The water is quite deep, but very, very clear. Because the water’s so clear you can see absolutely everything at the bottom, making it appear shallow, even though it’s actually very deep. Now imagine sitting by the side of this water and throwing small pebbles into the middle. Start off quite slowly, just throwing them every now and then. You’ll notice that each new pebble creates a ripple on the surface of the water, and that it takes a little while for the water to then settle again. If you then throw another stone in before the water has completely settled, you create a new set of ripples that merges with the last. Now imagine throwing one stone after the next and seeing the entire surface of the water all stirred up at the same time. When the surface of the water looks like this, it’s almost impossible to see anything in the water at all, never mind anything at the bottom. This image reflects the surface of our minds in many ways – at least until we get round to training in some way. Each new thought, like a pebble being thrown into the water, creates ripples on the surface. We’ve got so used to throwing these pebbles, so used to the disturbance on the surface of the water, that we’ve forgotten what still water looks like.

Clarity arises in its own time and its own way. Sometimes clarity will mean becoming more aware of the thinking process. At other times the awareness might shift to the emotions or physical sensations. Whatever happens and whatever you become more aware of, allow it to happen naturally. So, instead of resisting it because it’s unpleasant or uncomfortable, or trying to hasten its departure by delving into analysis, just allow it to happen in its own way and at its own pace.

Immanuel Kant argued that morality is based on the categorical imperative. This is essentially an update of Jesus’s golden rule (“Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.”) Kant uses a complex philosophical framework to claim that this rule gives us an objective, definite underpinning to all morality and that we need to start from there and derive all moral rules from it. On this basis Kant defines certain actions (such as lying) as being simply wrong (because we couldn’t possibly want to live in a world where we could never trust others not to lie to us).

It took about an hour for the mind to settle down. Strangely enough it seemed to happen at the same time that I started concentrating less on the thoughts and more on the task at hand. And while I appreciate cutting the lawn with a pair of scissors will not be everyone’s cup of tea, there was actually something very soothing about the process after a while. In fact, it became a meditation of its own. I figured there was no point in rushing, it didn’t really matter how many days it took me. And in being a bit of a perfectionist, there was something actually quite nice about trying to get it ‘just right’, and the less I indulged the thoughts, the less momentum anger had. As the anger decreased, so I could see more clearly what was happening in the mind. I started to get some perspective on things, which led to the mind becoming even more calm. It became cyclical: calm leading to clarity leading to calm leading to clarity.

Another way of describing meditation is to use the word ‘awareness’. So, if you’re unaware, then you are not meditating badly, you’re not meditating at all! It doesn’t matter whether you’re aware of lots of thoughts or of no thoughts. Nor does it matter whether you’re aware of pleasant feelings or unpleasant feelings. The skill is simply to be aware, that’s all.

When you sit to meditate it’s a little like watching this play. The images and voices are not you, in the same way that the play or the film is not you. It’s an unfolding story that you’re watching, observing and witnessing. This is what it means to be aware. Your own story, as in your own life, will still require direction and a sense of engagement, but when sitting to observe the mind during your meditation, taking a seat in the audience is by far the best way of watching. And it’s through developing that ability of passive observation that you get to experience the clarity and confidence to make decisions, make changes and live life more fully.

bear in mind that while the academic side of ethics can be befuddling, the goal in the end is simply to learn how to make good decisions, and how to practically and sensibly learn to be a better person. And if we can at least start there, we might gradually be able to move on towards the more idealized goal … of becoming the best person we can possibly be.

You can try to adapt rules-based systems by adding provisos: “don’t lie, unless there is an overpowering reason to do so”, for instance. But then how do you define the exceptions without leaving similar loopholes and getting into an infinite regress of counterexamples and unsatisfactory patches? It is this kind of challenge to rule-based systems that led to the development of utilitarianism from the 18th century onwards. The idea was to quantify our instincts that tell us that it is sensible and ethical to judge situations on the actual effects of our actions rather than purely following a rigid set of rules.

The final branch of the second layer is virtue ethics – rather than being based on rules or outcomes, this defines morality through character or personality – the suggestion is that we should work on being honest, caring, kind, brave and so on, and then we will tend to make moral choices without requiring rules.

So, what is ethics for? Some philosophers have claimed that if you understand that something is morally right it would be simply irrational not to do it. Yet we can see for ourselves that people can be both irrational and deliberately “bad”. It’s probably better to think of ethics as a moral map, and a way to think more roundly about disagreements. If we can be clear about what we agree and disagree on, it is easier to debate an issue rationally and calmly.

Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom, mental training is beneficial on many levels: “You begin exercising your brain by doing a certain task for the first time,” he writes. “And at first it seems very difficult, but as you learn how to do it, the training is already working. The second time, you realize that it’s easier, not harder, to do, because you’re getting better at it. This has a fantastic effect on a person’s mood. In and of itself, it is a transformation that affects not only the results obtained, but also his or her self-image.”

logotherapy can be summarized in these five steps: A person feels empty, frustrated, or anxious. The therapist shows him that what he is feeling is the desire to have a meaningful life. The patient discovers his life’s purpose (at that particular point in time). Of his own free will, the patient decides to accept or reject that destiny. This newfound passion for life helps him overcome obstacles and sorrows.

In Frankl’s view, however, there is no need to see this frustration as an anomaly or a symptom of neurosis; instead, it can be a positive thing—a catalyst for change. Logotherapy does not see this frustration as mental illness, the way other forms of therapy do, but rather as spiritual anguish—a natural and beneficial phenomenon that drives those who suffer from it to seek a cure, whether on their own or with the help of others, and in so doing to find greater satisfaction in life. It helps them change their own destiny.

Imagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect. You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how to move at each moment. There is no future, no past. There is only the present. You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a single entity. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or distracted by anything else. Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you are doing.

He keeps practicing for years until he finally does. Why does the apprentice refuse to give up? Doesn’t he get bored cooking eggs every day? No, because making sushi is his ikigai, too. Both Jiro and his son are culinary artists. They don’t get bored when they cook—they achieve a state of flow. They enjoy themselves completely when they are in the kitchen; that is their happiness, their ikigai. They’ve learned to take pleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time. Beyond the close relationship between father and son, which helps them keep the challenge going each day, they also work in a quiet, peaceful environment that allows them to concentrate. Even after receiving a three-star rating from Michelin, they never considered opening other locations or expanding the business. They serve just ten patrons at a time at the bar of their small restaurant. Jiro’s family isn’t looking to make money; instead they value good working conditions and creating an environment in which they can flow while making the best sushi in the world.

Rituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow. When we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed by it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the substeps, on the path to achieving a goal. When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts and then attack each part one by one. Focus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of flow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.”

Ellsworth Kelly, an artist who passed away in 2015 at the age of ninety-two, assured us that the idea that we lose our faculties with age is, in part, a myth, because instead we develop a greater clarity and capacity for observation. “It’s one thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I’m continuing to see new things. That’s why there are new paintings.”

Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our fast-food culture.

They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to make sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily calories comes from vegetables.

The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating foods with a high nutritional value (especially “superfoods”) and avoiding those that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value. The calorie restriction we’ve been discussing is one of the most effective ways to add years to your life. If the body regularly consumes enough, or too many, calories, it gets lethargic and starts to wear down, expending significant energy on digestion alone.

The Law of Victims says you can't be a victim if you don't relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim. When you surrender control to others, you essentially become a hitchhiker with no seat belt. You take the passenger seat in a stranger's car, which could be murderous to your financial plan. And when that happens, you're vulnerable to joining the ranks of victims.

The road to victimhood is through denial: First responsibility, then accountability. People who don't take responsibility are victims. Some of them are born victims and instead of trying to improve their hands, they fold and give up. For them, everyone has the solution to their problems but them. And their problems? Not their fault. Nope, someone else is to blame. Instead of looking within, they look outward and project responsibility to some other entity. Victims are Sidewalkers who refuse to take the driver's seat of their own lives and live under a dark cloud of “theys” reflective of a “me against them” attitude.

As I wrote this in 2008, the economy was in a tailspin. The housing market crashed, lending dried up, and millions lost their savings. How did that happen? It isn't complicated: We relied on “others” to make financial decisions for us. We ignored the fine print. We didn't read the contract. We didn't read the legislation and voted morons into office. We made the government an insurance policy. As a society, history is doomed to repeat if we continue to repeat the same behavior. And ten years later after this book was first written, nothing has changed.

Accountability is culpability to consequences and modifying your behavior to prevent those consequences. You can be responsible while not being accountable. A Fastlane Forum user does a great job distinguishing between responsibility and accountability: What kills me is when people make the same piss-poor choice multiple times but then claim to be responsible. It's easy to be “responsible” when responsible means just walking away. I've seen single parents who pledge to be “responsible” for the wild oats they've sown, only to occasionally send a check in the mail. I've seen people walk away from homes, claiming to be “responsible” for their actions, only to buy another home they can't afford. I've seen people being “responsible” for the actions their drinking and driving caused only to do it again! I am sick and tired of people being “responsible!” I want people to be accountable. People need to think before they act. Own their choices before they make them. I am okay with people making mistakes—but freaking own that you made a mistake and learn from it. That's what true accountability and responsibility is all about.

For my friend with the stolen purse, the Fastlane mindset is to take responsibility followed by accountability. Responsibility: It was my fault that my purse was stolen. Accountability: In the future, I will take precautions to ensure it doesn't happen again. Immunization for victimitis occurs when you are both responsible for AND accountable for your actions and the action's possible poor consequences. Own your mistakes, failures, and triumphs. Reflect on your choices. Are you in a situation because you put yourself there? Did you make an error in the process? Were you lazy? Most bad situations are consequences of bad choices. Own them, and you own your life.

We're being methodically brainwashed to believe that we deserve everything without obedience to process or accountability. You deserve what your actions earned or haven't earned. Being responsible is one thing; being accountable is another. When you're accountable for your choices, you alter your behavior in the future and take the driver's seat of your life.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Hitchhikers assign control over their financial plans to others, which effectively introduces probabilities to victimhood. The Law of Victims: You can't be a victim if you don't relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim. Responsibility owns your choices. Taking responsibility is the first step to taking the driver's seat of your life. Accountability is the final.

with increased responsibilities, perhaps a growing family, mounting debts, and expectations not matching reality, the Sidewalker comes to terms with the uncertainty of the Sidewalk. He does the seemingly responsible lane change: He off-ramps and graduates to the Slowlane roadmap, a strategy that exchanges one brand of Lifestyle Servitude for another. Instead of being imprisoned by your stuff, you become imprisoned by money itself. Suddenly life revolves around ascetic budgets, strict saving regimes, and patient stock market optimism.

wealth is best lived young and enjoyed while you have health, vibrancy, energy, and yes, maybe even some hair. Wealth is best lived in the prime of your life, not in its twilight after forty years of fifty-hour workweeks have pulverized your dreams into surrender.

Friday evening is celebrated because people are rejoicing the dividends of their trade: five days of work-bondage exchanged for two days of unadulterated freedom. Saturday and Sunday are the payment for Monday through Friday. Friday evening symbolizes the emergence of that payment, freedom for two days. The prostitution of Monday through Friday is why “Thank God it’s Friday” exists. On Friday, people are paid FREEDOM in the currency of Saturday and Sunday.

The problem is that we’ve been brainwashed to accept the Slowlane roadmap as normal. The defective roadmap gains traction early in life and is sanctified as the “commoners” only possible means to wealth.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The Slowlane is a natural course correction from the Sidewalk evolving from responsibility and accountability. Wealth is best experienced when you’re young, vibrant, and able, not in the twilight of your life. The Slowlane is a plan that takes decades to succeed, requiring masterful political prowess in a corporate environment, frugality, and Wall Street wizardry. For the Slowlaner, Saturday and Sunday are the paychecks for Monday through Friday. The default return on your time in the Slowlane is negative 60%—5-for-2. The 5-for-2 trade inherent in the Slowlane is generally fixed and cannot be manipulated because job standards are five days a week. In the Slowlane, Lifestyle Servitude is created via ascetic saving and investing rituals, whereas Lifestyle Servitude from the Sidewalk evolves from conspicuous consumerism. The predisposed destination of the Slowlane is mediocrity. Life isn’t great, but with enough mental gymnastics, it isn’t so bad either.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions In a job, you sell your freedom (in the form of time) for freedom (in the form of money). Experience is gained in action. The environment of that action is irrelevant. Wealth accumulation is thwarted when you don’t control your primary income source. Jobs delimit your power to accumulate wealth and attaches poor economics to your life. Jobs give you an automatic subscription to “pay yourself last.”

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Slowlane wealth is improbable due to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL). The first variable in the Slowlane wealth equation stems from a job that factors to intrinsic value, which is your nominal value for each unit of your life traded. Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace and is measured in units of time, either hourly or yearly. In the Slowlane, intrinsic value (regardless of its time measurement) is numerically inhibited because there are only 24 hours in the day (for the hourly worker), and the average lifespan is 74 years (for the salaried worker). Like the Slowlaner’s primary income source (a job), the Slowlaner’s wealth acceleration vehicle (compound interest) is also pegged to time. Compound interest is mathematically futile and cannot be manipulated like a job. You cannot force-feed the market (or the economy) to give you phenomenal returns, year after year. Wealth cannot be accelerated asymmetrically when pegged to mathematics based on time. Time is your primordial fuel, and it should not be traded for money. Your lifeforce should not be an expendable resource for wealth because it is composed of time. Your mortality makes time mathematically retarded for wealth creation. If you don’t control the variables inherent in your wealth universe, you don’t control your financial plan.

Wealth by the Slowlane roadmap is analogous to Exodus, the biblical story of Moses. God leads Moses out of Egyptian bondage into a brutal 40-year journey through the desert, with the promise of a triumphant future in the land of “milk and honey.” After a lifetime of toil and struggle, Moses arrives at the doorstep of his destination and—wham! He dies. He never sees the promise of the journey because life has no guarantees.

To assume that you will live a long, healthy life is arrogant. To presume that life won’t throw you any curves is naïve. For the Slowlane to prevail, it assumes life is predictable and forgiving. It isn’t. You lose your job. You get sick. The car needs a new transmission. You get married. You get divorced. You have kids. You have a child with special needs or elderly parents who need care. The economy dips into recession or depression. A global pandemic deems your job as “non-essential.” Life is a menagerie of crisis points, making the Slowlane roadmap a risky bet that consumes your most precious asset: time.

a Slowlaner will try to manipulate his weak mathematical universe by making the variables malleable. Manipulate intrinsic value by increasing hours worked. (I need to make more money!) Manipulate intrinsic value by changing jobs or adding jobs. (I need to get paid more!)  Manipulate intrinsic value by going back to school. (I need a better career!) Manipulate compound interest by seeking better investment yields. (I need better investments!) Manipulate compound interest by expanding the investment time horizon. (I need more time!) Manipulate compound interest by increasing the investment. (I need to save more!) Each of these six responses is a futile attempt to manipulate the impotence of the Slowlaner’s wealth equation.

They drive unassuming cars like Hondas or Toyotas, they infrequently vacation, limit their restaurant visits, cut coupons, and max out their retirement accounts.

a “millionaire” (net worth of $1,000,000) is simply middle class in today’s terms. Hell, it’s not even upper middle class any longer. A millionaire is not rich. Or, as I like to say, the title “millionaire” is now about as impressive as a used Toyota Camry. In today’s inflationary age, you need to be a baby-billionaire (one billion pennies or $10 million) to really have financial freedom while enjoying the perceived “millionaire lifestyle.”

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The Slowlane has seven dangers, five of which cannot be controlled. The risk of “lifestyle” is the one risk Slowlaners will try to control. The Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because its mathematical universe is mediocre. Slowlaners manipulate the “expense” variable because it is the one thing they can control. Relentless expense reduction through lifestyle deprivation forces another form of Lifestyle Servitude. Exponential, asymmetrical income growth and expense management create wealth—not just by curtailing expenses. You can break the Slowlane equation by exploding your intrinsic value via fame or insider corporate management. Successful Slowlaners not famous or in corporate management end in the middle . . . middle class and middle age. Slowlane millionaires are stuck in the middle class. A “millionaire” no longer implies wealth, riches, or financial expertise—it’s about as impressive as a used Toyota Camry. $10 million, or a baby-billionaire, is the new $1 million. A millionaire cannot live a millionaire lifestyle without financial discipline. Lottery winners fall into the millionaire trap and go broke because they attempt to live a “millionaire” lifestyle, not understanding that a few million doesn’t go very far.

The Fastlane is a business and lifestyle strategy that swaps Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL) with Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL), creating an optimal environment for rapid wealth creation and extraordinary lifestyles. Definitively, pay attention to these four segments: Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL) - Whereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage. Business -Your own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane. Lifestyle - The Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions. Rapid Wealth Creation - The Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth asymmetrically and beyond the confines of the “middle class.” Fastlane asymmetry is when a $1000 investment in a business venture transforms into $10,000,000 several years later.

The Industrial Revolution was a historical period when humans learned how to leverage the speed and efficiency of machine-based manufacturing. Manual labor was replaced by systems, a union of distinct parts merged into a specific production outcome. Long and arduous tasks manually handled by humans transformed into mechanization, expelling most human labor out of the production equation.

Under my wealth equation, my upper limit of wealth is “units sold” and currently stands at 12,000. Of course, 100% conversion is unreasonable, and “converting” all 12,000 is unlikely. Likewise, in the Slowlane, the limited upper limit is 24 because there are only 24 hours in the day. Logically, the absolute upper limit is 8 to 12 hours per day.

Slowlaners and Fastlaners have two antagonistic views of “assets.” Slowlaners and Sidewalkers buy and sell depreciating assets that decline over time. Cars, boats, electronics, designer clothes, gadgets, and sparkly bling to impress that newly divorced woman in the adjacent cubicle—these are all assets that lose value the moment your credit card is charged. Contrary to this, Fastlaners buy and sell appreciating assets: businesses, brands, cash flows, notes, intellectual property, licenses, inventions, patents, and real estate. As it relates to the Fastlane wealth equation, the power of “Asset Value” lies in your ability to control the variable in a virtually limitless fashion.

Since asset value is tied to net profit, raising net profit elevates asset value simultaneously by the average industry multiple. Of course, this works in the opposite as well; if your company stalls and net income falls, so will the corresponding asset value.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The key to the Fastlane wealth equation is to have a high-speed limit or an unlimited range of values for units sold. This creates leverage. The market for your product or service determines your upper limit. The higher your speed limit, the higher your income potential. The primary wealth accelerant for the rich is asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought. Wealth creation via asset value is accelerated by each industry’s average multiplier. For every dollar in net income realized, the asset value multiplies by a multiple factor. Your industry of specialization will determine the average multiple that determines your wealth accelerant factor. If the multiple is 3, your WAF is 300%. Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“paper” net worth) into money (“real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions To divorce yourself from the Slowlane’s transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner. Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they act like surrogate operatives for your time trade. You’re retired if you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses, including taxes. Retirement can happen at any age. The fruit from a money tree is passive income. A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time. The 5 money-tree seedlings are rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human-resource systems. Real estate, licenses, and patents are examples of rental systems. Internet and software businesses are examples of computer systems. Authoring books, blogging, and magazines are forms of content systems. Franchising, chaining, network marketing, and television marketing are examples of distribution systems. Human resource systems can add or subtract to passivity. Human resource systems are the most expensive to manage and implement.

Conversely, magnitude has a great impact on a few, and within our Fastlane wealth equation is reflected in UNIT PROFIT. Price always reflects magnitude. If you sell a product worth $50 million, you have access to magnitude. For example, if you owned an apartment complex with 400 units and profit $100 from each unit, you'd generate $40,000 monthly income. Because you provide housing for 400 families, you are making an impact of magnitude, not scale. Shelter has magnitude. Activities of magnitude have higher profit potential with smaller scales. Magnitude is always reflected by an item's price. High value = high price = high magnitude.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect or breach, both in scale and magnitude, the richer you will be. Scale translates to “units sold” of our profit variable within our Fastlane wealth equation. Magnitude translates to our profit variable's “unit profit” within our Fastlane wealth equation. The Law of Attraction is not a law but a theory. The Law of Effection is absolute and operates exclusively from a roadmap. All lineages of self-made wealth trace back to the Law of Effection. The Law of Effection's absoluteness comes from direct access and control (you are the athlete) versus indirect access (the athlete's agent). You must serve millions in scale or a few in magnitude to make millions.

Fastlane success demands a well-tuned vehicle primed and tuned for the journey that awaits. You are the vehicle to wealth. You are the impetus for action and progress. You are responsible for the journey, and the first step in taking charge of you is to own yourself.

If you aren’t familiar with “pay yourself first,” it’s a Slowlane doctrine that urges you to save your money (pay yourself) before food, gas, car payments, and other bills. This supposedly forces the Slowlaner’s savings rate to accelerate their putrid wealth acceleration vehicle: compound interest via market investments.

The leading cause of poorness is poor choices and how we react to the hand we're dealt. The steering wheel of your life are your choices. You are exactly where you chose to be. Success is hundreds of choices that form the process. Process forms lifestyle. Choice is the most powerful control you have in your life. Treasonous choices introduce DAREs or Downside Asymmetric Risk Events, which have the power to erase thousands of good decisions. DAREs forever impact your life negatively, sometimes permanently. Your choices have significant horsepower or trajectory into the future. The younger you are, the more potent your choices are and the more horsepower you possess. Over time, horsepower erodes as the consequences of old choices are thick and hard to bend.

This seemingly innocent choice of perception has the excruciating horsepower of treason. It is a crippler of dreams.  The teen’s choice of perception was poor, and because of it, it would forever lead him to mediocre results. His jury had already deliberated, and the verdict was in: A luxurious car would always be “out of his league,” so his choices would reflect that mindset. Unfortunately, he didn’t understand the debilitating effect of being clouded by our own self-constructed windshield into the world.

Your choices of action manifest from your choices of perception. What you choose to perceive or not perceive will manifest itself as a choice of action or inaction. You can change your choice of perception by aligning yourself with those who experience the perception as reality. Worst Case Consequence Analysis helps avoid treasonous choices. The Weighted Average Decision Matrix can help you make better big decisions by clarifying alternatives and their internal factors. The universe has no memory; only you do.

life can deteriorate into a vicious self-perpetuating cycle, which is society’s prescription for normal: Get up, go to work, come home, eat, watch a few episodes of Law and Order, go to bed . . . then repeat, year after year. Before you know it, 45 years have passed, and you need another 25 just to make your financial plan work. Time passes, dreams die, and what remains? An old, withered body, sad for what could have been. Who blows stinky headwinds? They are: Friends and family who just don’t get it. Media and educational institutions who preach Slowlane dogma. Parents who are conditioned to believe wealth is for other people. Slowlane gurus who claim your house is the best investment. Slowlane gurus who say $100 invested today will be worth $10 million in 50 years. Your environment.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Fastlaners start their education at graduation, if not before. A Fastlaner’s education serves to advance their business system and money tree, not to raise intrinsic value. Fastlaners aren’t interested in being a cog in the wheel. They want to be the wheel. “I don’t know how” is an excuse dismantled by discipline. Infinite knowledge is everywhere, and it’s free. What’s missing is the discipline to assimilate it. You can become an expert in any discipline not requiring physical skills. Educational refreshes can occur within time blocks already allocated for other objectives. Organizers of expensive seminars take advantage of Sidewalkers and disenfranchised Slowlaners by marketing empty promises as “events.”

Interest is first gear. Commitment is the Redline. Hard work and commitment separate the winners from the losers. Some choose short-term mediocre comfort over long-term meteoric comfort. To live unlike everyone else, you must do what everyone else won’t. Arm your expectations to hard work, sacrifice, and other bumps in the road. These are the land mines where the weak are removed from the road and sent back to the land of “most people.” Failure is natural to success. Expect it and learn from it. One home run could set you financially secure for your life, perhaps generations. Home runs can’t be hit in the dugout. Moronic risks have an unlimited downside (long term) and limited upside (short term). Intelligent risks have an unlimited upside (long term) and limited downside (short term.) There is never perfect timing and waiting for “someday” wastes time.

When you control your business, you control everything in your business—your organization, products, pricing, revenue model, and operational choices. If you can’t control every aspect of your company, you’re not driving! And if you can’t drive, you set yourself up for sudden, unexpected crashes.

To hit big or legendary money, you need to control every aspect of your system. When you relinquish control and defer power to a higher authority, you cede big money to the driver and accept good money as the passenger.

I can’t imagine running a company in which another entity has the power to instantly kill your revenue stream. If someone can “flip a switch” and destroy your business, you’re playing roulette with your financial plan. The congenital danger of hitchhiking is that you give up the keys to the driver. If the driver crashes into a wall, guess who goes with them.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Hitchhikers relinquish control of their business to a Fastlaner. There is a difference between “good” money and “big” money. Hitchhikers can make good money while Fastlaners make big money. Sometimes legendary money. In a driver/hitchhiker relationship, the driver retains control, and the hitchhiker is at the driver’s mercy. Hitchhikers are subordinated to someone else’s Fastlane plan. Make the world your habitat of play in an organization you control. Network marketing has little to do with entrepreneurship but more to do with sales, networking, training, and motivation. Network marketing fails both the Commandments of Control and Entry and, sometimes, Need. Network marketers are soldiers in a Fastlaner’s army. Network marketing is a robust distribution system. As a Fastlaner, seek to own one, not join one. Network marketing can have some excellent educational value in sales, motivation, and team building. If you can succeed at network marketing, you should be able to succeed in a Fastlane venture.

Higher entry barriers equate to more robust, more powerful roads with less competition and the need for exceptionality. Low-barrier-entry businesses are weak roads because easy entry creates high competition and high traffic, all of which share the same pie. And where there is traffic, there is no movement.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers fall, competition rises, and the road weakens. Accessible roads carry more traffic. More traffic generates higher competition, and higher competition creates lower margins for the participants. Businesses with weak entry often lack control and operate in saturated marketplaces. Exceptionalism is required to overcome weak entry barriers. Access to a business road should be a process with a toll, not an event. “Everyone” consists of the general populous and is served by the mainstream media. If everyone were wealthy, “everybody is doing it” would work. And if everyone is wealthy, then no one is wealthy. “Everyone is doing it” is a signal to overbought conditions and the entrance of “dumb money.”

Businesses that solve needs and provide value win. Businesses that solve problems win profits. Selfish, narcissistic motives do not make good, long-term business models.

People care about what your business can do for them. How will it help them? What's in it for them? Will it solve their problem? Make their life easier? Provide them with shelter? Save them money? Educate them? Make them feel something? Why on God's green Earth should I give your business money? What value are you adding to my life? Reflect to our producer/consumer dichotomy. Consumers are selfish. They demand to know “what's in it for me!” To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others.

Money is like a mischievous cat; it eludes you if you chase it around the neighborhood. It hides up a tree, behind the rose bush, or in the garden. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts the cat, it comes to you and sits in your lap. Money isn't attracted to selfish people. It is attracted to businesses that solve problems. It's attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs massively, and money massively attracts. The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection of the amount of value you have given to others.

Remember when your life was turned upside down with excitement or discontent. That is your passion. An exciting passion was when I saw my first Lamborghini as a teenager, and I decided, “One day, I will own a Lamborghini.” My discontented passion was watching my mother struggle in dead-end jobs, trying to raise three kids without a husband. Both fueled my passion; I wanted a Lamborghini, and I wanted to help ease the burden on my mother. Excitement (wants and desires) serves as passionate fuel, as does discontent (undesirable situations). Both allowed me to do what others wouldn't. If you find yours, you will too.

CHAPTER SUMMARY: FASTLANE DISTINCTIONS The Commandment of Need states that businesses that solve needs win. Needs can be pain points, service gaps, unsolved problems, or emotional disconnects. Ninety percent of all new businesses fail because they are based on selfish internal needs, not external market needs. No one cares about your selfish desires for dreams or money; people only want to know what your business can do for them. Money chasers haven't broken free from selfishness, and their businesses often follow their own selfish needs. People vote for your business with their money. Chase money, and it will elude you. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts money, you will draw it to yourself. Help one million people, and you will be a millionaire. For money to follow “Do what you love,” your love must solve a need, and you must be exceptional at it. “Do what you love” sets the stage for crowded marketplaces with depressed margins. When you have the financial resources, you can “do what you love” and not get paid for it, nor do you have to be good at it. Slowlaners feed “do what you love” with “do what you hate.” Five days of hate for two days of love. “Doing what you love” for money can endanger your love. Passion for an end goal and a “why” drives Fastlane success. Having a passionate “why” can transform work into joy. “Doing what you love” usually violates the Commandment of Need. The right road for you will converge with your dreams.

As a Fastlaner, you can start any business, but eventually, you must strive for automation. You want passivity and a living money tree. When you fail the commandment of time, the failure is caused by one of two obstacles. They are: You don't have access to the seeds because your business road started with a deficiency. The seeds won't grow in infertile soil.

How do you know if your business (or potential business) honors the Commandment of Scale? Ask: Can the profit of this business scale limitlessly, say, from $2,000 per month to $200,000? Can the asset value of this business scale asymmetrically into the millions? Can this business impact thousands, or better, millions of lives? Or does it impact hundreds? Is its customer pool the world or a small community in the city? Can this business be replicated and expanded beyond the local trading area by franchising, chaining, or additional units? Best-case scenario, what is the unit-sold potential? One hundred or one hundred million? Best-case scenario, how pliable is unit profit? Does it have magnitude?

The other barricade to Effection is Magnitude. Because our coffee shop owner is restricted in scale, his other option is scale by magnitude. Unfortunately, the magnitude road is also closed. Unit profit cannot be manipulated. Every sale won’t generate a profit greater than a few bucks, and raising prices reduces units sold.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Your total pool of customers determines your habitat. The larger the habitat, the greater the potential for wealth. A business can be a single or a home-run-based business. Its strength is determined by scale, which is derived from habitat. The Fastlane wealth equation is disarmed when you violate the Commandment of Scale. Scale is achieved in reach (units sold) and/or magnitude (unit profit). The Law of Effection is the primary conduit to wealth, which can be road-blocked by scale, magnitude, or source. Effection consequences trickle up to owners and producers. Breaking scale or magnitude indirectly in an uncontrolled entity is not a guarantee of wealth. To gain access to Effection, you must break the barrier of scale or magnitude in an entity you control. Scale, magnitude, or source deficiencies create governors on the speed of wealth creation.

Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over the process. When I analyzed the limousine service as a potential business, it wasn’t a pure Fastlane. The operation had satisfied the control and entry criterion, but it didn’t have scale; it served the northwest suburbs of Chicago. The operation didn’t have time detachment; I would have had to log long hours, and the margins weren’t thick enough to deploy human resources. And it certainly didn’t solve an unmet need; in Chicago, limo companies were a dime a dozen.

Value skew is anything your business does better than the competition AND is discernible by your target audience, causing them to buy. Value skew is a solution to an inconvenience. Value skew is a simplification. Value skew is a feeling of excitement, comfort, or prestige. Value skew is better service, better ingredients, or a better label or user interface. Value skew is not being a big-tech bully who censors anyone they disagree with. Value skew is having a noble purpose behind your company.

quitting your road and changing directions is sometimes the best choice.

Competition should not impede your road. Competition is everywhere, and your objective should be to “do it better” by skewing value attributes. Fastlane success resides in execution, not in the idea. The world’s most successful entrepreneurs didn’t have blockbuster ideas; they just took existing concepts and made them better or exposed them to more people. Opportunity is exposed in your language, thought processes, and other people’s language. Failure cracks open new roads. Quitting only happens when you give up on your dream.

There are two strategies to hit your destination. The first is a money system which is a large sum of money saved and invested, large enough that it can support your lifestyle through monthly interest and dividends. I call this an escape number, the amount you need to officially “retire” at your desired lifestyle level. The second is a business system that spawns passive cash flow that supports your lifestyle AND simultaneously funds your money system.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The Fastlane is the means to your end because dreams cost money. Conquer big goals by breaking them down to their most minor component. Daily saving reinforces your relationship with money; it is your passive system that buys freedom and another soldier added to your army. A money system isn’t used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth should be left to your Fastlane road. You will struggle to build a financial empire if you are financially illiterate. “Live below your means” is relevant at any income level. For the Fastlaner, “Live below your means” means to expand your means. A financial adviser doesn’t solve financial illiteracy, and literacy is insurance. Financial illiteracy dilutes your control, especially when evaluating the advice of a financial adviser.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Speed is the transformation of ideas to execution. Most people let powerful information expire and become worthless. Successful Fastlane businesses are run multi-dimensionally, like a game of chess. One-dimensional businesses focus on price only. Execution divides winners and losers from their ideas. In business, execution is a process. Ideas are events. Ideas are potential speed. Execution is actual speed. Others share your blockbuster idea. He who thinks the idea owns nothing. He who executes the idea owns everything. Real money and momentum are created when an idea (potential speed) is matched with execution (accelerator pressure). An idea is neurological flatulence. Execution makes it smell like a rose.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The world gives clues to the direction you should be moving. Business plans are useless because they are ideas on steroids. As soon as the world interacts with your ideas, your business plan is invalidated. The marketplace will steer you into directions that were previously unplanned. The best business plan in the world is a track record of execution—it legitimizes the business plan. If you have a track record of execution, suddenly, people will want to see your business plan. If you want your business to get funded, act and create something that reflects actual execution. Investors are more likely to invest in something tangible and real, not ideas dissected endlessly on paper.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Complaints are valuable insights into your customers’ minds. Complaints of change are difficult to decipher and often require additional data to validate or invalidate. Complaints of expectation expose operational problems in either your business or your marketing strategy. Complaints of void expose unmet needs, raise the value of your product or service, and expose new revenue opportunities. Excellent customer service is as simple as violating your customer’s low expectations in the positive. Poor service gaps are Fastlane opportunities. Satisfied customers can be human resource systems that promote your business for free. Satisfied customers have a dual residual effect: Repeat business and new business via discipleship. Your customer’s satisfaction holds the key to everything you selfishly want. Looking big but acting small sets up customer service expectation violations in the positive. Looking big can scare away potential competitors.

Accountants and attorneys have the keys to your castle; make sure you trust them entirely because they have the power to right or wrong you. Unmitigated trust exposes you to unmitigated risk. Unverified trust can lead to uncontrollable consequences. Your employees drive the public's perception of your company. Fanatical customer service can overcome shortcomings, but fanatical features can't overcome poor customer service.

Businesses founded on false premises will rocket into the commoditization bin and force you to do the inevitable: To play checkers. What is commoditization? Commoditization is a product or service that appears homogeneous among providers. For example, a heavily commoditized service is air travel. Most people aren't loyal to any airline; they're loyal to the best price.

People tend to make buying decisions for commoditized goods and services based on one metric: price. If you don't, the business has done an excellent job differentiating its product from the alternatives. If your product isn't unique, it doesn't stand a chance, and you're forced into the strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.”

Notice how these USPs target benefits. I don’t like Domino’s Pizza (despite once being employed by them), and yet that didn’t stop them from building a pizza empire based on the USP of “delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less—or it’s free.” Domino’s identified the need: Pizza delivery was a long ordeal. They solved it, branded it, and the rest is history. More recently, Dominos became the first major fast pizza chain to offer vegan cheese as an option. This value skew broadened their total addressable market to a swath of new consumers who had never considered the chain.

If you are already in business, find your most significant product benefit that sets it apart from the competition. If you don’t have a distinct advantage that’s obvious to your potential buyer, you’re operating without a USP.

Everyone is in the top 1% of their game, including the authentic top 1%. You see, we all are marketers, and some of us are marketers of an illusion. This creates an abundance of noise and makes it harder for genuine value providers to be heard. Your marketing efforts must rise above the noise.

People don’t care about you, your business, your product, or your dreams; they want to help themselves and their families. It’s human nature. Therefore, our marketing messages must focus on benefits, not features. People need to be told exactly what’s in it for them.

As consumers, we buy things to solve needs. We participate in transactions to fill voids. You don’t buy a drill; you buy a hole. You don’t buy a dress; you buy an image. You don’t buy a Toyota; you buy reliability. You don’t buy a subscription to a goal service, you buy potential results. You don’t buy a vacation; you buy an experience. We must become problem solvers and align our business as a savior to someone. Features must be translated into benefits.

There’s an old story about how price equates to value. Cleaning his basement, a man found an old dresser and decided to give it away. He moved the dresser to the street corner and placed a sign atop it: FREE. Shockingly, the dresser stood there all day and for several days after that. This confused the man because the dresser, albeit old, was in decent shape and just needed a quick wood stain for perfection. The man decided a new strategy was warranted. He went to the street corner and replaced the “FREE” sign with “$50.” Not an hour later, the dresser was stolen. Same objective, different pricing strategy.

Price is a part of the brand build. Premium pricing is one of the many ways to get into the consumer’s head. But only if you can convince them of value beyond the cost of its practicality. What makes you different from the rest? Why should someone pay you more? As a marketer, you have to drill into your buyer’s minds and get your brand differentiated. Own the consumer’s mind, and you own the consumer.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Marketing and branding (the queen) are the most potent Fastlane tools. Businesses survive. Brands thrive.  Businesses have identity crises, but brands don’t. Identity crises force business owners into price commoditization. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) are your primary value skew and the key branding attribute that differentiates your company from the rest. People have a natural desire to be unique and different. Marketing success requires messages to break above the noise or advertising clutter. Polarization is a tremendous tool if your product targets a polarized audience—usually politics, minority opinions, and even sports teams. Sex sells and always draws eyeballs. (But it can tarnish your brand image.) Consumers make buying decisions based on emotions before practicality. If you can arouse audience emotions, convincing customers to buy is easier. People like talking about themselves. You will have better success if you can incorporate interaction or “try before you buy” into your campaigns. To be unconventional means to isolate and identify what is conventional, then do the opposite, or interrupt that convention. Consumers are selfishly motivated. Always target your messages toward the predisposition of “What’s in it for me?” Features are translated to benefits when you switch positions from producer to consumer, identify the feature’s advantages, and extrapolate those advantages into a specific result. A cheap and a premium price are value skews, implicitly conveying value and worth. Don’t allow your own perception of price to tarnish your brand to mediocrity.

When you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets. Weak assets don’t do the heavy lifting, and they don’t build strong pyramids. Weak assets do not generate speed. Weak assets do not scale to multimillion-dollar valuations. Weak assets do not accelerate wealth; they build an income to pay the month’s bills only to start again next month.

There’s a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as “scenius.” Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up an “ecology of talent.”

Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contribute—the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start. If we forget about genius and think more about how we can nurture and contribute to a scenius, we can adjust our own expectations and the expectations of the worlds we want to accept us. We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others.
